# 12 - Requirements Module

## General Description

This module defines the **non-functional requirements (NFRs)** of the system, covering aspects of **performance, security, usability, scalability, monitoring, and development roadmap**.

It ensures the Personal Finance Management System complies with enterprise-grade standards and regulatory requirements (LGPD, GDPR).

---

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance

- **API response time**:
  - 95% of requests < 500ms.
  - Dashboard load < 2s.
  - Reports (yearly) < 5s.
- **Database operations**: Simple queries < 100ms.
- **File uploads**: < 10s for 5 MB receipts.

### Throughput & Capacity

- Support **1,000 concurrent users** in MVP.
- Handle **10,000 requests per minute**.
- Background job workers: ≥100 jobs/min (notifications, sync, etc.).
- Notification throughput ≥500 messages/min (email + WhatsApp).

### Availability & Reliability

- Uptime target: **99.5%**.
- Recovery Time Objective (RTO): < 4h.
- Recovery Point Objective (RPO): < 1h.
- Maintenance windows limited to 2h/month.

---

## Security Requirements

### Authentication & Authorization

- OAuth2 + OIDC via **Keycloak**.
- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)** support.
- Session timeout after 30m inactivity.
- Account lockout after 5 failed logins.
- Role-based access control (RBAC) + fine-grained permissions.

### Data Protection

- AES-256 encryption at rest.
- TLS 1.3 for data in transit.
- PII anonymization in logs.
- Passwords hashed (`argon2` preferred).
- Regular vulnerability scans (OWASP Top 10).

### Compliance (LGPD/GDPR)

- Explicit **consent management**.
- Data minimization → only essential user data stored.
- Right to be forgotten → full delete & anonymize.
- Right to access/export personal data (CSV/JSON).
- Breach notifications within 72h.
- Full audit logs for sensitive operations.

---

## Usability Requirements

- Responsive design (desktop + mobile).
- Accessibility compliance: **WCAG 2.1 AA**.
- Multi-language support (Portuguese, English).
- Max **3 clicks** from dashboard to any primary action.
- Consistent UI/UX across all modules.
- Offline support for **view-only mode** with cached data.

---

## Scalability Considerations

- Stateless services for horizontal scaling.
- Kubernetes / container deployment.
- Database clustering & read replicas.
- Redis clustering for cache + job queues.
- Event-driven architecture readiness (microservices split).
- Capable of supporting **100,000+ users** and **10M+ yearly transactions**.

---

## Monitoring & Testing Strategy

### Monitoring

- Health checks → `/health` endpoint.
- Metrics → Prometheus + Grafana dashboards.
- Error tracking → Sentry.
- Log aggregation → ELK Stack.
- Uptime monitoring → Pingdom/StatusCake.

### Testing

- **Unit tests** → 80% coverage target.
- **Integration tests** → all API endpoints.
- **E2E tests** → critical flows (recurring expenses, reconciliation).
- **Performance tests** → load with 1,000 concurrent users.
- **Security tests** → penetration + automated scans.
- **Accessibility tests** → automated WCAG checks.

## Development Roadmap

### Phase 1: MVP (8 weeks)

- User authentication (Keycloak).
- Income & Expense CRUD.
- Categories.
- Basic dashboard with charts.
- Email notifications.

### Phase 2: Enhanced (6 weeks)

- Recurring transactions.
- Savings goals.
- WhatsApp notifications.
- Advanced analytics.
- Receipt upload + OCR.

### Phase 3: Integrations (8 weeks)

- Open Finance sync.
- Auto-categorization.
- Transaction reconciliation.
- Mobile app.

### Phase 4: Collaboration (4 weeks)

- Shared accounts.
- Audit logs.
- Collaborative budgeting.
- Advanced exports (PDF/Excel).

---

## Key Observations

- System must adhere to **security by design** principles.
- Data architecture must support **high volume growth**.
- Roadmap prioritizes **quick MVP** → then expand with automation + collaboration.
